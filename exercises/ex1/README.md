# Exercise 1 - Explore Standard Events in SAP S/4HANA Cloud

In this exercise, we will look at enabling events in SAP S/4HANA. Then we will log into SAP Event Mesh and look at our queue and the respective queue subscription. In a next step we will create a test queue and a queue subscription. We will then open our shared extension application. Next, we will update our business partner in SAP S/4HANA and as a result trigger an event. We can now see how this event immediately disappears from our queue, and can look at it in detail in our test queue. Next, we can see that the customer/business partner has been added to the extension application.
