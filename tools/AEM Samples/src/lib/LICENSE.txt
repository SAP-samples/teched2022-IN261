If Licensee requires a license from SOLACE to enable Licensee to bundle or otherwise make available a Product with Licensee’s own software, such bundling will be pursuant to separate terms to be agreed.

1.2 Documentation.
Provided Licensee complies with this Agreement, Licensee may reproduce the Documentation, for use on an internal basis only, and solely in support of the permitted uses for the applicable Software. Distribution of the Documentation outside of Licensee is prohibited without the express written permission of SOLACE.

2 SPECIAL LICENSE GRANTS
Notwithstanding Section 1.1, the following special licenses and restrictions, in lieu of the terms in Section 1.1 will apply to Software designated as Sample Applications, Evaluation Software Release or APIs:

2.1 Evaluation Software Releases.
If the Software provided to Licensee under this Agreement is designated by SOLACE in an Order or otherwise as an evaluation release (indicated by terms such as “pre-commercial”, “alpha,” “beta,” “trial,” “draft,” “early access,” “EA” or “evaluation”) (each an “Evaluation Software Release”), Licensee will have the limited right under this Agreement to download and install the Software on the number of devices identified in the Order or, if not identified, one device, for the Licensee’s internal and non-commercial evaluation of the Software.
Licensee acknowledges that the Evaluation Software Release may not meet performance and compatibility standards of a production version. The Evaluation Software Release may not operate correctly, may be substantially modified by SOLACE prior to first commercial shipment, and may be withdrawn completely and never issued for commercial use.
If Licensee desires other rights for the Evaluation Software Release, Licensee must request from SOLACE a commercial release of the Software.
The limited use license granted in subsection (a) will automatically expire on the earlier of: (i) the date when the Software is made available to Licensee as a commercially available product, and (ii) the date specified in the Order or, if no such date is identified in the Order, the date that is 90 days after the date of delivery or provision of the Evaluation Software Release to Licensee. Following license expiry Licensee will permanently delete or otherwise purge such Evaluation Software Release from Licensee’s systems and, if requested by SOLACE, certify the same.

2.2 License of APIs.
Provided Licensee complies with this Agreement and any terms that SOLACE provides, SOLACE grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, royalty free license, during the term of this Agreement, to download, install and use, the applicable application programming interfaces that may be made available by SOLACE with the Software (“APIs”) solely to create interfaces between the Software and the Licensee’s software or third party software on Licensee’s systems.

2.3 License to Sample Applications.
SOLACE may, in its sole discretion, provide certain sample Software in source code or object code form for the purposes of demonstrating certain features enabled by the Software, including demonstrating to Licensees how to build applications using APIs, and for use by Licensees with such APIs (each, a “Sample Application”).
Whether provided separately or together with other Software, if SOLACE provides such Sample Application to Licensee, then SOLACE hereby grants to Licensee a non-sublicensable, non-transferable, non-exclusive, revocable license, to install such Sample Application for Licensee’s evaluation for the same duration as the Software with which the Sample Application is associated or such other duration as specified by SOLACE upon delivery of the Sample Application.

3 OPTIONAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT

Licensee acknowledge that certain optional services, such as training, integration and development services may be provided by SOLACE in association with the Products, and access to such services will be provided separately pursuant to terms to be agreed and may include separate fees.

3.2 Support.
Provided Licensee complies with this Agreement, SOLACE will provide support for the Software licensed pursuant to Section 1.1 in accordance with SOLACE’s then standard support terms and the provisions therein that apply to such Software.  The level of support will be dependent on whether Licensee has procured either the ‘Premium Support Plan’ or ‘Standard Support Plan’ defined in SOLACE’s then standard support terms.
SOLACE may enhance such standard support terms from time to time in its discretion.
For greater clarity, SOLACE’s then standard support terms do not apply to Evaluation Software Releases, Sample Applications or any free versions of the Software that may be made available.  SOLACE may make available support related information on a free basis for such Software on its publicly accessible website or otherwise, and such support related information will, for greater clarity, be subject to the limitations and exclusions in this Agreement.

All invoices issued by SOLACE are due and payable within 30 days of the invoice date unless otherwise agreed in an Order.  Licensee will be responsible for any and all sales, use, excise, import, value-added, services, consumption, and other taxes assessed on the receipt of the Products, and any related services as a whole.

5.1 Back-up Copy.
In addition to the number of copies of the Software installed and used pursuant to Section 1.1 and paid for in accordance with Article 5, Licensee may make one copy of each licensed Product per subscription solely for back-up purposes, provided that Licensee reproduces all copyright and other proprietary notices that are on the original copy of the Software and such back-up copy is not installed or used other than for back-up and recovery purposes.

5.2 Prohibition on Right to Sub-License.
Sublicensing under this Agreement is prohibited except in accordance with Article 9.

5.3 Third Party Licenses.
The Software may contain or require third party software that is licensed under third party terms.  SOLACE may direct Licensee to such third party terms, and in some instances the Software cannot be used or further distributed without Licensee’s acceptance of such terms.  Any failure of Licensee to agree to the terms applicable to such third party software may undermine certain functionality of or prevent Licensee from using the Software.

5.4 Representations; No Encumbrances and Open Source Software.
Licensee will not represent to third parties, or use any third party software or code in conjunction with: (i) the Software; or (ii) any software, products, documentation, content or other materials developed using the Software, in such a way that: (A) creates, purports to create or has the potential to create, obligations for SOLACE with respect to the Software; or (B) grants, purports to grant, or has the potential to grant to any third party any rights to or immunities under any Intellectual Property Rights of SOLACE, as such rights exist in or relate to the Products.

The restrictions, limitations, exclusions and conditions referred to under subsection (b) will apply even if SOLACE becomes aware of or fails to act in a manner to address any violation or failure to comply therewith.  No act by SOLACE that is undertaken under this Agreement in respect to any Products will be construed as intending to cause any Intellectual Property Rights that are owned or controlled by SOLACE or any of its affiliates (or for which SOLACE or any of its affiliates has received license rights) to become subject to any encumbrance or terms and conditions of any Open Source License.

5.5 Use Restrictions.
Licensee will not: (a) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, or translate the Software (other than Sample Applications), or otherwise attempt to derive the source code version of the Software, except if and only to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, and provided that Licensee first approaches SOLACE and seeks permission in writing; (b) except as expressly permitted under Section 1.1, use the Products or any portion thereof to create or develop any developer tools (including plug-ins and middleware) or any software; (c) except as expressly permitted in this Agreement, rent, lease, loan or otherwise in any manner provide, transfer or distribute the Products or any part thereof to any third party; or (d) except as expressly permitted under Section 1.1, reproduce, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display or create adaptations or derivative works of or based on the Products.

6 CONFIDENTIALITY

6.1 Definition of Confidential Information.
In this Agreement “Confidential Information” of a Party means any information of a Party (including in respect to SOLACE any of its affiliates, licensors, customers, employees or subcontractors) (the “Disclosing Party”), whether oral, written or in electronic form, which has or will come into the possession or knowledge of the other Party (the “Receiving Party”) in connection with or as a result of entering into this Agreement that can reasonably be considered to be confidential in the circumstances of disclosure or which is designated as confidential. The Products, any performance information, service levels, support terms, and results of testing of the Software, and the terms of this Agreement are Confidential Information of SOLACE. Notwithstanding the foregoing, “Confidential Information” does not include information that is:
 publicly available when it is received by or becomes known to the Receiving Party or that subsequently becomes publicly available other than through a direct or indirect act or omission of the Receiving Party (but only after it becomes publicly available);
 established by evidence to have been already known to the Receiving Party at the time of its disclosure to the Receiving Party and is not known by the Receiving Party to be the subject of an obligation of confidence of any kind;
 independently developed by the Receiving Party without any use of or reference to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party as established by evidence that would be acceptable to a court of competent jurisdiction;
 received by the Receiving Party in good faith without an obligation of confidence of any kind from a third party who the Receiving Party had no reason to believe was not lawfully in possession of such information free of any obligation of confidence of any kind, but only until the Receiving Party subsequently comes to have reason to believe that such information was subject to an obligation of confidence of any kind when originally received; or
 Feedback provided by Licensee or a representative of Licensee.

6.2 Confidentiality Obligation.
Each Party will, in its capacity as a Receiving Party: (i) not use or reproduce Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose, other than as may be reasonably necessary for the exercise of its rights or the performance of its obligations set out in this Agreement; and (ii) not disclose, provide access to, transfer or otherwise make available any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any third party except as expressly permitted in this Agreement.
Each Party may, in its capacity as a Receiving Party, disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party: (i) if and to the extent required by a governmental authority or otherwise as required by applicable law, provided that the Receiving Party must first give the Disclosing Party notice of such compelled disclosure (except where prohibited by applicable law from doing so) and must use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Disclosing Party with an opportunity to take such steps as it desires to challenge or contest such disclosure or seek a protective order.  Thereafter, the Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, but only to the extent required by applicable law and subject to any protective order that applies to such disclosure; and (ii) to: (A) its accountants, internal and external auditors and other professional advisors if and to the extent that such persons need to know such Confidential Information in order to provide the applicable professional advisory services relating to the Receiving Party; and (B) employees of the Receiving Party and its subcontractors if and to the extent that such persons need to know such Confidential Information to perform their respective obligations under this Agreement;provided that any such person is aware of the provisions of this Section 6.2 and has entered into a written agreement with the Receiving Party that includes confidentiality obligations in respect of such Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party that are no less stringent than those contained in this Section 6.2.

6.3 Consent to Injunctive Relief.
Any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information of SOLACE, its affiliates or licensors may cause irreparable harm and significant injury to SOLACE that would be difficult to ascertain or quantify; accordingly Licensee agrees that SOLACE will have the right to seek and obtain injunctive or other equitable relief to enforce the terms of this Agreement and without limiting any other rights or remedies that SOLACE may have.

7 WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.

7.1 Warranty.
SOLACE warrants that the Software licensed pursuant to Section 1.1 will materially comply with the Documentation.

All other support will be dependent on whether Licensee has procured either the ‘Premium Support Plan’ or ‘Standard Support Plan’, to the extent set out and defined in SOLACE’s then standard support documentation as referred to in Section 3.2.

any use, reproduction or distribution of the Products (notwithstanding the restrictions and obligations in this Agreement), as modified or integrated by Licensee in Licensee application, which causes an infringement or misappropriation of any Intellectual Property Right, publicity or privacy right of any third parties arising in any jurisdiction anywhere in the world, except and solely to the extent such infringement is caused by the unmodified Software, or portions thereof, as supplied to Licensee by SOLACE under this Agreement; or
any use, downloading, distribution, installation, storage, execution, or transfer of the Products in breach of this Agreement.

In this Agreement: (a) headings of Articles and Sections are inserted for convenience of reference only and do not affect the construction or interpretation of this Agreement; (b) where the word “including” or “includes” is used in this Agreement, it means “including (or includes) without limitation”; (c) unless the context otherwise requires, words importing the singular include the plural and vice versa and words importing gender include all genders; (d) a reference to a statute includes all regulations and rules made pursuant to the statute and, unless otherwise specified, the provisions of any statute, regulation or rule which amends, supplements or supersedes any such statute, regulation or rule; (e) unless otherwise specified, or agreed in an Order, all references to money amounts are to the lawful currency of the US;  (f) the language used in this Agreement is the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction will be applied against any Party; and (g) the recitals are part of this Agreement.

14.7 Waiver.
To be effective, any waiver by a Party of any of its rights or any other Party’s obligations under this Agreement must be made in a writing signed by the Party to be charged with the waiver.  No failure or forbearance by any Party to insist upon or enforce performance by any other Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any rights or remedies under this Agreement or otherwise at law or in equity will be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such Party’s right to assert or rely upon any such provision, right, or remedy in that or any other instance; rather, the same will be and remain in full force and effect.  A Party’s waiver of a breach of any term will not be a waiver of any subsequent breach of the same or another term.

14.8 Cumulative Rights.
The rights of each Party hereunder are cumulative and no exercise or enforcement by a Party of any right or remedy hereunder will preclude the exercise or enforcement by such Party of any other right or remedy hereunder or which such Party is otherwise entitled by law to enforce.

14.9 Severability.
If, in any jurisdiction, any provision of this Agreement or its application to any Party or circumstance is restricted, prohibited or unenforceable, the provision will, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent of the restriction, prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement and without affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction, or without affecting its application to other Parties or circumstances.

14.10 Assignment.
SOLACE may assign this Agreement or any of the benefits, rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Licensee.  Licensee may not assign this Agreement or any of the benefits, rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of each of SOLACE. Any attempt by Licensee to so assign or transfer is null and void. If SOLACE does consent to an assignment of this Agreement, the transferee/assignee must be acceptable to SOLACE and agree to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

14.11 Enurement.
This Agreement enures to the benefit of and is binding upon the Parties and their respective successors (including any successor by reason of amalgamation of any Party) and permitted assigns.

14.12 Further Assurances.
The Parties will, with reasonable diligence, do all things and provide all such reasonable assurances as may be required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party will provide such further documents or instruments required by any other Party as may be reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the purpose of this Agreement and carry out its provisions.

14.13 Governing Law and Jurisdiction.
This Agreement is governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable therein, without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. Any Claim arising out of or related to this Agreement must be brought exclusively in a federal or provincial court located in Ottawa, Canada, and Licensee hereby consents to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts.  Each of the Parties irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent it may effectively do so, the defence of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action, application or proceeding.  The Parties will not raise any objection to the venue of any action, application, reference or other proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement in the federal or provincial courts sitting in Ottawa, including the objection that the proceedings have been brought in an inconvenient forum.  A final judgment in any such action, application or proceeding is conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner specified by law.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly disclaimed and will not apply.
